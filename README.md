<p align="center"><b>TLDR</b>: Contribute <code>BIG D</code>, get <code>F R E E</code> <code>S H I R T</code> <code>M A I L E D  T O  Y O U</code>!</p>

Many people are daunted by the idea of making a their first contribution on public repositories. Hence, OpenSUTD has created this repository to encourage members of the SUTD community to learn more about open source and GitHub! This shall be a fun and harmless environment for you to make your first contribution on GitHub via a **pull request**.

This month is also [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/), which means that you can get a free shirt mailed to you by contributing pull request. Hacktoberfest is an annual, month-long celebration of open source software run by [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) and other sponsors. During this month (1 Oct to 31 Oct), contribute **at least four pull requests** to **any** GitHub respository and a **free** Hacktoberfest T-shirt will be mailed to you!

## Cool, so what can I contribute?

We encourage you to contribute various types and interpretations of `D`s into this repository! 

Examples (just some ideas) of possible contributions:

* Various `D` files (`d.py`, `d.txt` and so on - demonstrate your knowledge of file formats!)
* Funny scripts that do things related to `D`
* Dank stuff, I know we have many meme lords in the crowd

**Just keep things harmless and safe for work! No indecent contributions will be tolerated**

For more information, take a look at the [Hacktoberfest FAQ](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/faq).

## Is there a backstory?

This repo? It was loosely inspired by [this legendary GitHub repository](https://github.com/eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee/eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee) ([story here](https://linuxwit.ch/blog/2018/12/e98e/)), but instead of manymany `e`s, we are doing manymany`D`s! Why? Because we're SUTD, and big `D` is our thing, and we want to collect all kinds of `D`s!

This is also inspired by other repositories set up during previous Hacktoberfests to encourage people from all around the globe to make their first public contributions on GitHub and the online open source community.
